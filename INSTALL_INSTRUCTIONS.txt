Smart Schedule & Digital Signage Installation Instructions
===================================================

This package contains two applications:
1. Smart Schedule - A schedule management system for educational institutions
2. Digital Signage - A digital signage solution

The following instructions will guide you through the installation process for both projects.

Prerequisites:
-------------
1. XAMPP installed on your computer (Apache and MySQL)
2. Administrator privileges on your computer

Installation Steps:
-----------------
1. Extract the ZIP/RAR file to a location of your choice.

2. Right-click on the "install_projects.bat" file and select "Run as administrator".
   This is necessary to give the script permission to copy files to the XAMPP directory.

3. The script will:
   - Check if XAMPP is installed in common locations
   - If XAMPP is not found, you will be prompted to enter your XAMPP installation path
   - For each project (Smart Schedule and Digital Signage):
     - Verify if the project folder already exists in htdocs (and ask if you want to overwrite it)
     - Copy all project files to the XAMPP htdocs directory
   - You can choose to install either one or both projects

4. After the files are copied, follow these steps:
   - Start XAMPP Control Panel and ensure Apache and MySQL services are running
   
   For Smart Schedule:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost/smart_schedule/install/
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to import the database
   - Once installation is complete, access the application at: http://localhost/smart_schedule/
   
   For Digital Signage:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost/digital_signage/install/
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to import the database
   - Once installation is complete, access the application at: http://localhost/digital_signage/

Folder Structure:
---------------
When compressing these projects, use the following structure:
- install_projects.bat (at the root)
- INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt (at the root)
- /smart_schedule/ (folder containing all Smart Schedule files)
- /digital_signage/ (folder containing all Digital Signage files)

Troubleshooting:
--------------
- If the batch file cannot find XAMPP, make sure it's installed and provide the correct path when prompted
- If copying fails, ensure no applications are using the files and that you have administrator privileges
- If you encounter database errors during installation, make sure MySQL is running and the root password is correct
